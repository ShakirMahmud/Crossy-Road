# Crossy-Road
In this project, we developed a Crossy Road game
using Three.js. Crossy Road is a popular arcade game where
the player controls a chicken character trying to cross roads
and avoid various obstacles, including moving vehicles. We
successfully implemented the core features of the game, including
player controls, road generation, vehicle movement, and collision
detection.
